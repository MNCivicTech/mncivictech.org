# MN Civic Tech Website

The MN Civic Tech website is a Next.js application using Typescript that serves as both a marketing tool and an internal
hub, showcasing our mission, community project work, ways to get involved, a blog, and details about upcoming events and
initiatives.

The Slack channel for this project is at [`#proj-website`](https://mncivictech.slack.com/archives/C081BG59A92)

## Getting Started

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with [React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager). 

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository. Once in the directory, you can
download the dependencies to `node_modules` using `pnpm install`. Afterward, you can start the web application's server
using `pnpm dev`.

### Development mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website, and any code changes will be hot reloaded.

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
